# Bug Bounty Write-Ups

Welcome to my bug bounty write-ups repository! This repository contains my own write-ups on various topics, including bug bounty hunting. Additionally, it includes "Friend Links" to the write-ups that are behind the paywall on Medium, so you can access them even if you don't have a Medium membership.

## Introduction

Bug bounty programs are initiatives offered by many organizations, including technology companies and websites, to reward individuals for discovering and reporting software bugs. Write-ups often detail the process of discovering and exploiting these vulnerabilities, providing valuable insights and learning opportunities for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals.

This repository aims to contribute to the community by sharing my experiences and insights, particularly in bug bounty hunting.
